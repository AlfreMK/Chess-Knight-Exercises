# Chess Knight Exercises

Inspired in [Jair Trejo's website](https://www.funnyhowtheknightmoves.com/) and [Dan Heisman's Exercises](https://www.danheisman.com/chess-exercises.html) chess exercises, this is a web app that allows you to practice more chess knight moves (yes, I know, I'm a knight lover).

You can access to the app [here](https://alfremk.github.io/Chess-Knight-Exercises/).

Enjoy!
