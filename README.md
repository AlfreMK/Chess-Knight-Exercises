# Chess Knight Exercises

Inspired in [Jair Trejo's website](https://www.funnyhowtheknightmoves.com/) and [Dan Heisman's Chess Exercises](https://www.danheisman.com/chess-exercises.html), this is a web app that allows you to practice more chess knight moves (yes, I know, I'm a knight lover).

Among the exercises, you can find 3 obstacle knight courses *(Check The King 1, 2 & 3)* and 3 full route knight courses *(Full Route 1, 2 & 3)*.

You can access to the web app [here](https://alfremk.github.io/Chess-Knight-Exercises/).

Enjoy!
